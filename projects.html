    <h2><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
    <p>
        In today's fast-paced urban environments, congestion on arterial roads has become a pressing concern affecting daily commuting, economic productivity, and overall quality of life.To address this critical issue, our project embarked on an in-depth analysis to estimate and understand the factors contributing to congestion on urban arterial roads. Through meticulous data collection and advanced analytical techniques, we aimed to uncover valuable insights that could aid in developing effective traffic management strategies.
    <h2><u>OBJECTIVE</u></h2>
        The primary objective of our project was to estimate and quantify congestion levels on urban arterial roads. We sought to identify the key factors influencing congestion and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize traffic flow and enhance urban mobility.
    <h2><u>METHODOLOGY</u></h2>
        Our research utilized a multifaceted approach, combining both primary and secondary data sources. We collected real-time traffic volume data, travel time data, and historical congestion records to build a comprehensive dataset. Additionally, GPS and geographical data were employed to study traffic patterns and identify congestion hotspots. Advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms were applied to process and analyze the data.
    <h2><u>DATA COLLECTION</u></h2>
        We collaborated with local transportation authorities to gain access to traffic flow data from sensors and cameras installed on arterial roads. We also leveraged mobile apps and GPS devices to collect anonymized travel time data from commuters. Historical traffic data and road infrastructure information were sourced from public databases and research publications.
    <h2><u> ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS</u></h2>
        Our analysis revealed significant variations in congestion levels based on time of day, day of the week, and seasonal factors. Peak hours and rush periods exhibited the highest congestion levels, indicating potential opportunities for targeted traffic management interventions. Moreover, we identified key bottlenecks and areas where congestion frequently occurs, providing crucial insights for infrastructure improvements.
    <h2><u>CONCLUSIONS</u></h2>
        The estimation of congestion on urban arterial roads is essential for developing informed and sustainable urban transportation policies. Our project sheds light on the complex dynamics of traffic flow in urban environments and offers valuable insights to tackle congestion effectively.
    <h2><u>RECOMMENDATIONS</u></h2>
     <h3>Based on our research, we propose the following recommendations to alleviate congestion on urban arterial roads:</h3> <br>
    <li>Implement real-time traffic management systems that dynamically adjust traffic signals and lane configurations to respond to changing congestion patterns.</li> <br>
    <li>Invest in infrastructure upgrades, such as widening bottleneck areas and optimizing signal timings, to enhance traffic flow and reduce congestion.</li> <br>
    <li>Encourage the adoption of alternative transportation modes, like public transit, cycling, and carpooling, to reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road.</li> <br>
    <li>Utilize data analytics and machine learning for proactive congestion prediction and management. </li><br>
    <li>Foster public awareness campaigns to educate commuters about peak traffic hours and promote travel schedule adjustments for better traffic distribution.</li> <br>
